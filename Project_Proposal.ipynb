    "# Introduction\n",
    "Research has demonstrated that all Pacific salmon species have declined in size over the past century (Oke et al., 2020). Larger female fish have a greater fecundity (number of eggs per female) as well as larger eggs. Larger eggs are positively correlated with greater chance of juvenile survival; a greater number of eggs produce greater numbers of juveniles (Dickerson et al., 2002). Size of males, on the other hand, does not determine how many eggs they are able to fertilize. **With this in mind, we aim to investigate whether the observed overall decline in size is driven by differential change in size in female or male Chinook salmon (Onchorynchus tshawytscha).** For this, we will compare the differences in `median` length of female and male Chinook salmon between the 1960s and 2010s. **We hypothesize that the males’ difference in medians will be greater than the females’**. To investigate this question, we examine the dataset of Pacific salmon catch data from Alaska used by Oke et al. to demonstrate the overall size decrease over the last century. \n",
    "\n",
    "Biologically, the `median` location parameter is most suitable as it best represents the middle of the data. A ‘middle’ fish size is more useful than an ‘average’ fish size since outliers have less influence on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `interquartile range` because the use of standard deviation is not appropriate with non-normal data. Furthermore, a central tendency is also not present as our data is not strictly ‘normal’ due to the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n"
